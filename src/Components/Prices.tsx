                        As the founder of TechHerStory, I established this brand with a vision to bridge the gap between technology and underrepresented communities, particularly focusing on empowering women and artisans. Born out of a commitment to give back to society, TechHerStory is dedicated to helping women, regardless of their educational backgrounds, break into the tech industry and leverage technology to enhance their lives and skills.<br />
                        Our non-profit organization, under the TechHerStory umbrella, is dedicated to supporting artisans through empowerment programs, technology training, and community engagement initiatives. We collaborate with government bodies, NGOs, and corporate partners to ensure holistic support and resource sharing. Our mission is to empower artisans with the necessary skills, financial literacy, and technological knowledge to thrive in a rapidly evolving market.<br />
                        TechHerStory serves as a strong community offering mentorship programs, networking events, skill-building workshops, and initiatives tackling challenges women face in tech workplaces. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion in the tech industry is reflected through various programs such as diversity profiles, inclusive hiring practices, and collaborative efforts with diverse groups.<br />
                        Moreover, we foster STEM education among young girls and underrepresented students, laying the foundation for their involvement in tech from an early age. Through creative ideas like interviews, community forums, social media engagement, and industry spotlights, we strive to create an inclusive environment where women feel supported and empowered.<br />
                        At TechHerStory, our mission is to empower women to break into the tech industry and leverage technology across various sectors, regardless of their current skill level or career stage. We envision a future where women are confident, skilled, and well-represented in the tech space, thriving in an inclusive and diverse environment.<br />
